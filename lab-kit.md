# Lab kit

A take-home lab kit for CPE 1040, LP004-005.

## 1. Breadboard

A breadboard is a plate with through-holes and electrical connections for use with hands-on circuit building and prototyping. This is the white plastic block shown on the picture below. There are also a [power supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13032) (with a [wall adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15314) and a [microbit connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13989).

The power supply is connected to one end of the breadboard along the short side. The microbit connector is connected to the middle of the long side of the breadboard, along the A column (when looking at the side opposite to the one where the power supply is installed). Take a look at the next pictures:

### Guide

SparkFun, who assembled the lab kit for us, has very thorough guides:
1. For [using a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all), including the power supply. Pay special attention to how the breadboard rows and columns are connected. This is something you have to get used to.    
2. For [hooking up the micro:bit to the breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/microbit-breakout-board-hookup-guide).  

### Care

Pay attention to these care directions:
1. Take a look at this [image from the SparkFun guide](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/2/f/9/d/a/513a1dfbce395fe524000001.JPG) for the correct connection of the power supply. The [header pins](https://www.mouser.com/images/samtec/images/samtec_mtms_SPL.jpg), of which it has 2 groups of 4 on both sides, have to be inserted into the rails of the breadboard, in the first two rows on one end, with the VCC label on the side of the red rail line and the GND on the side of the blue rail line.  
2. To make the power supply more stable, you can use a piece of hard putty underneath it.

3. The power supply has two tiny switches, one for ON-OFF and one for 3.3V-5V. _Handle the switches very gently._ When the power supply is on, a red LED is lit up. It is brighter for 5V than for 3.3V. We will use 3.3V for our projects.  
4. The micro:bit works at 3.3V, but we won't be powering it from the power supply, but through the USB cable or battery. _Do not plug the micro:bit connector into one of the rails!_  
5. Pushing in the micro:bit connector takes quite a bit of force. _Use a hard flat surface (e.g. scissors) to push straight down, to avoid mangling the header pins._
